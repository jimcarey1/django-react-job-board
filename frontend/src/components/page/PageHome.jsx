                Every company has a mission. What's ours? To empower every person 
                and every organization to achieve more. We believe technology can and 
                should be a force for good and that meaningful innovation contributes to a 
                brighter world in the future and today. Our culture doesn’t 
                just encourage curiosity; it embraces it. Each day we make progress 
                together by showing up as our authentic selves. We show up with a 
                learn-it-all mentality. We show up cheering on others, knowing 
                their success doesn't diminish our own. We show up every day open 
                to learning our own biases, changing our behavior, and inviting 
                in differences. Because impact matters.
